## Flask Application Design for a Google Docs Clone

### Key Features

- **Real-time collaboration:** Multiple users can simultaneously edit the same document, seeing each other's changes in real-time.
- **Document versioning:** Changes made to a document are automatically saved, with prior versions accessible for restoration if needed.
- **File format compatibility:** The application should support commonly used file formats such as DOCX, PDF, and TXT.
- **Markdown support:** Users should be able to edit documents using Markdown syntax for easy formatting.
- **User management:** The application should allow users to create accounts, log in, and have their own workspace for managing documents.

### Design Considerations

- **Database:** Choose a suitable database, preferably a NoSQL database like MongoDB, to store user data, document metadata, and document content.
- **File storage:** Design a strategy for storing document files, considering performance, security, and scalability.
- **Collaboration mechanism:** Implement a real-time messaging system to enable users to see each other's changes instantly.
- **Security:** Ensure that user data and documents are securely stored and transmitted. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the application and its features.
- **UI/UX:** Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for editing documents, managing files, and collaborating with others.

### Potential Challenges

- **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a large number of users and documents without performance degradation.
- **Real-time collaboration:** Maintaining consistency among multiple users editing the same document in real-time can be challenging.
- **File format conversion:** Converting documents from one format to another without losing data can be intricate and error-prone.
- **Security:** Protecting user data and documents from unauthorized access and malicious attacks is of utmost importance.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly testing the application to ensure its stability, reliability, and correctness is crucial.

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: The main page of the application, this file displays a list of the user's documents and provides options for creating a new document, inviting collaborators, and editing existing documents.
- `document.html`: This file displays the document editing interface. It includes a text editor, formatting tools, and options for saving and collaborating.
- `profile.html`: This file displays the user's profile, including their name, email address, and profile picture.

### Routes

- `/`: The route for the main page of the application.
- `/documents`: The route for displaying the list of the user's documents.
- `/documents/create`: The route for creating a new document.
- `/documents/:id`: The route for editing a specific document.
- `/documents/:id/collaborators`: The route for managing collaborators for a specific document.
- `/profile`: The route for displaying the user's profile.
